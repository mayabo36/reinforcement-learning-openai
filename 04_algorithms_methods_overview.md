# Problem 4

List all algorithms and methods that we have covered in this course. Write 3 sentences to describe what each algorithm and method solves etc.


- **Breadth First Search**: This algorithm works to find the shortest path to an item, location, or goal state. It does so my searching breadth wise, exploring all neighbor nodes before searching deeper. We used this in our Pacman AI algorithm for eating all the pellets in a maze.

- **Depth First Search**: This algorithm also works to find the shortest path to an item. However, unlike in DFS, it search as deep as it can first before searching neighbor nodes. We used this in our Pacman AI algorithm for eating all the pellets in a maze.

- **Uniform Cost Search**: This algorithm also works to find the shortest path to an item. It searches using a priority queue 

- **AStar Search**: heuristics

- **Minimax**:

- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**:

- **Expectimax**:

- **Better Evaluation Function**:

- **Value Iteration**:

- **Q-Learning**:

- **Epsilon Greedy**:

- **Approximate Q-Learning**:

- **Cross-Entropy Method**:
